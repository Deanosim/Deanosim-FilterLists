# Currently none of this stuff actually works (Apart from the allow list which is my own personal list of domains I need unblocked).
# I'll have to eventually rewrite all the stuff in this repo.

# dns-lists
Project on hold because some domains refuse to work with adguard and so now I put lancache-dns in front of adguard
Automate creating dns rewrite lists for [lancachenet](https://github.com/lancachenet/) using [cache-domains](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains) and github actions.

## Instructions: Soonâ„¢

## Install:
just copy the raw url into pihole or adguard home

### Adguard: (Doesn't work either)
- due to the fact that Adguard doesn't accept DNS rewrites in list form and so just ignores it when it's an allow or deny list.
- Work around might be possible using [this](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/922), [this](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/390), and [this](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/4385)
- Also noticed that using a modified version of [scripts](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains/tree/master/scripts) I was able to generate the lists in plain old DNS format which can be inserted into Adguard as custom filtering rules ```192.168.1.100 lancache.steamcontent.com``` for example, only problem is that requires a lot of copying and pasting.

### Pihole: (Pihole list currently doesn't work, and just blocks everything)
- Currently my setup for pi-hole I just put all the .conf files generated by using the dnsmasq [scripts](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains/tree/master/scripts)
